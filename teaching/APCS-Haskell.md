# Part A: Haskell Introduction (5 weeks)

The first unit of the class will last until progress reports are issued.

## Goals
1. Use a "strongly typed" programming language - preparation for Java.
2. Review and strengthen planning skills (the design process and top-down plan from Intermediate CS). 


## Text and Resources

* [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), Chapters 1-6.
* [repl.it Haskell](https://repl.it/languages/haskell)

* Install [Haskell Platform](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) at home.
    
## Numbering of Sections

The sections in each chapter of *Learn You a Haskell* are not numbered. In class I will refer to them as if they were numbered in the order that they appear in the [Table of Contents](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) online.
